        <h2>A Byte About Me</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          It's nice to finally meet you. Allow me to introduce myself. My name
          is Samantha... Samantha Shirley.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry if you get them mixed them up, it happens all the time.
          It's the curse of having a first name for a last name.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a stay-at-home mom, I started to dabble in art by creating
          paintings to decorate my childrens' rooms. A hobby which quickly
          turned into a small business "artventure" that allowed me to stay at
          home to raise my kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          I soon found myself needing an online portfolio and ecommerce store.
          And so I began to dabble in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL to
          develop and design my own websites. I spent a lot of sleepless nights
          with Google trying to solve coding puzzles. But the more I delved into
          the code, the more it became a language I began to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining my love of art with my love of coding is a passion that lead
          me to study
          <em>Internet Applications & Web Developement</em> at St. Clair College
          followed by <em>Game Programming</em> at Centennial College.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my natural artisitc creativity and education in hand, I am ready
          to help you get your next great app developed.
        </p>
